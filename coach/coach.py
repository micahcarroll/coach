The image you have access to is my computer screen. Let me know if you think my current activity is in line with my goals. Below are example responses, so you know what format to use.
If you leave a message for the user, this will pop up as a notification on their screen, so be mindful of interrupting them if they are already productive.

Response:
- Productive: True
- Description: From the screen, it can be seen that the user is writing code for a project called "ABC", which is in line with their goal to "Finish project ABC".
- Message for user: None

Response:
- Productive: False
- Description: From the screen, it can be seen that the user is scrolling social media, which is not productive because it has nothing to do with accomplishing their goal.
- Message for user: You are scrolling social media, which is not productive because it has nothing to do with accomplishing your goal. You should really be working on your goal to "Finish project ABC" instead.

CURRENT GOAL: {goal}
